"""This is a very efficient numpy-based decoder for BUFR files. It is aimed at decoding volumetric radar data provided by the DWD, but it should be 
sufficiently general to handle much more formats. It works at least for edition 3, but is also expected to work with edition 4.
Two things that are at least not yet supported, are BUFR files with multiple subsets in section 4, and a section 2 in the BUFR file. If a section 2
is present, then it is simply skipped (but the decoding of the other sections should still succeed).
Further, only a few operators are supported yet, but it shouldn't be that difficult to include support for more operators.
Also, compression within the BUFR file is not handled yet.

Decoding of the BUFR starts by converting the content to a 1D array of bits (uint8 type, implying that 8 times more memory is used than originally).
Next, the meta data is obtained, which includes a list of the descriptors that are present in section 4. 
When decoding section 4, which contains the data, one important reason for the efficiency of the decoder is the way in which loops (indicated by replication
operators) are treated: 
    First, the size of the data that is contained in the loop in determined, which is the number of bits contained in the loop.
Next the data for each loop (and possible nested loops) is put in a different array, which is reshaped in such a way that the last dimension includes the
descriptors for one iteration of the loop. This allows efficient slicing of the data when actually decoding it, which is the final step.

A drawback of this method is that it is not very memory efficient, among others because the BUFR is converted to an array of bits (as mentioned above), but
also because the data for each nested loop is stored in a different array (see the function get_bits_in_loops). If memory usage becomes important, then the first
step to reduce memory usage should likely be finding a more efficient way to store data for different nested loops.

A DWD-specific piece of code decompresses bz2-compressed data. If other types of compression are carried out, then the appropriate decompression must be included.


Part of the code is based on/ copied from the package trollbufr, created by Alex Maul: https://github.com/alexmaul/trollbufr
That's completely the case for the script load_tables, and for a large part for the script decode_metadata.
